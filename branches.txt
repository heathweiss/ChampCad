    -merged with parameters.
    B: parameters
       -created delaunayBase, so as to leave delauany alone.
       -make fx's such as createAdvancingCPoint and removeIfUsed be passed into delauany so it can be used as a framework for different fx's
        -done.
        -also made an almost complete delauanyBase fx to get passed into delaunayBase for creating advancing line when there are both inner and outer perims available.
       -make a datatype for the joinedCpoints, so other things can be added for the new fx's to be passed in.
        -not yet done
