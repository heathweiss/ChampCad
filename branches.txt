master/gmsh:

Commented out GL.insert as there will no longer be a need to insert that data in the BuilderStateData.
However, will still need to make the lines, and their id and points, so they can be printed out as gmsh script, so don't delete yet.

Commented out a lot of tests, as GB.ExceptStackCornerPointsBuilder now has IO at the btm. Will need to rewrite these tests using the underlying
fx's, without the monad stack, or figure out how to write tests in IO monad.
 

GB.ExceptStackCornerPointsBuilder return type  is now GC.BuilderMonadData
It has a separate constructor for each type of data, so far:(the alternative is a single constructor with Maybe values).
BuilderMonadData_CPoints: allow to build up [CPts]
BuilderMonadData_GPoints: allow to build up a [] of gmsh point id's.
BuilderMonadData_Points: extract target Pts.Points from the CPts, so they can be converted into gmsh points.


Added the ability to extract Points from CPts, and return as BuilderMonadData_Points.
Need to clean this up. See firstTest.

master->gmsh->gmsh_gpoints
done:Create the gmsh points from the [Point], and save them to state, as well as the current BuilderMonadData value.
commit: 'can create gpoints from points'
-can: git reset --hard HEAD 
 or   
      git reset --hard 'can create gpoints from points'
-done:Create a GPointId type, to have a [GPointId] for the current builder monad value.
 It is a newtype wrapper around the current Int value required by gmsh.
 Change the BuilderStateData [point id] from int to GPointId
commit: 'GPointId done'

rename GC.PointsBuilderData to show that is is part of state, and it includes both GPointId and Pts.Point info.
will be GPointsStateData
commit: 'PointsBuilderData renamed to GPointsStateData'

next:
Figure out when I will write the GPoints to file.
I need them at a point, where exist prior to being inserted into GC.BuilderStateData.GPointsStateData,
so that I can only write the ones which do not already exist.
This is in GMSH.Points marked with a 'leftOff'.
Added GP.insert<with/without>overlapping.

Next: is to write the points which will require a handle.
commit 'can overlap. Ready to write.'
Did this, but can't perform IO inside if GP.insert<...>
Do a commit so can look at while at work.
commit -m 'cannot perform io in GP.insert'

Can now write the gpoints to file, from a [FrontFace].
Need a lot of clean up and testing.
commit: 'can write gpoints to file'

doing:
done:
simplify the GPoints, as it only needs to be an id.
So:
-get rid of the GPointsStateData and replace with GPointId.
next: clean up
Got rid of the duplicate insert fx's that were in GMSH.<Points/Builder>.
Just left if commented out so it can be pushed in it is needed later.
commit: 'removed GMSH redundancies'

done:
merge gmsh_points into master and gmsh, and deleted.
now on branch gmsh

next:
reorganize GMSH.Builder so it has:
Base
CornerPoint
Pts.Points
GPoints

next:
print comments in gscript so the output can be matched up to the builder.

next:
make lines from the gpoints or points, whichever it is I will use..
will need the idea of overlapping points.

next:
add a handle in GMSH.Writer to write to a standard file, and maybe one that takes a file name, but writes to standard directory.
