B: master
   -have a delaunayBaseNM which replaces delaunayBase. Still has some issues.
     -Got rid of Applicative and went to Monad. Much better/cleaner.
     -Keep delaunayBase till these are worked out. May want to start printing shoes.
   -Intercept has new ExceptT Maybe type which has cleaned up the code immensely.
     -lineIntercept from Rosetta code does not work with negative cood's. Need better system.
        -Will try a branch that uses polar coods.
  B: intercept:
     -Geometry.Intercept.lineIntersection does not work with neg cood's. Fix it perhaps with polar cood's.
