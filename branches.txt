master: has gmsh merged up to and including break up of tests.

master/gmsh:
Now prints out gmsh Points script.
Next:
Print out the gmsh Lines script:
Save the Point at each end of the line,
which can then be used to retrieve the Point id's.

master/gmsh2:
Added IO to the GB.ExceptStackCornerPointsBuilder and now can print gmsh script to a file as the monad is run.


master/gmsh2/g2_changeData
GB.ExceptStackCornerPointsBuilder:
-renamed GC.BuilderData to GC.BuilderStateData
-commented out GL.insert as there will no longer be a need to insert that data in the BuilderStateData
 However, will still need to make the lines, and their id and points, so they can be printed out as gmsh script.
 

-Need to replace the GB.ExceptStackCornerPointsBuilder [CornerPoints] with a datatype that contains not just the cornerpoints, but also and script info that needs to be printed.
 This data structure has been started in GC.BuilderMonadData. There is a leftOff there thats stops compilation.
 This data includes the line.
